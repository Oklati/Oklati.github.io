I code alot in a daily basis. I dont know why, but i always loved that orange cat jumping up & down. I'm talking bout scratch of course. The Best programming lang i learned through ma life.


But for you newbies who still code in C/C++ ima teach U something that will blow your mind!

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const argv[])
{   
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    while(n--)
        printf("%d\n", n);
    return 0;

}

{% endhighlight %}
